            <p>
            You watched 
    lizadaly
 passing through the bay where you live.
            They said they began this journey  a day ago.
            You decided to join them yesterday on
            a foggy day.
            </p>

            <p>
            They had laid a sturdy path of corncockle
                cobblestones until their pockets were empty. You don't carry stones,
                but instead planted behind you a trail of tulip flowers.
            <p>

    threepress
 observed  
    lizadaly
 
                    passing through the inlet where they lived and chose to follow. They travelled along
                    the corncockle
                    cobblestone path until the stones ran out. They planted instead a trail of
                    rosemary flowers for others to follow them.

                

                They set out on a heavy day.
