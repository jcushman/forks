            <p>
                You started this journey over a day ago.
                You left from your home in the countryside. It was a rainy day.
            </p>
            <p>
                To help others follow you, you lay behind a winding path of corncockle
                cobblestones.
            </p>

 observed  you 
                    passing through the inlet where they lived and chose to follow. They travelled along
                    the corncockle
                    cobblestone path until the stones ran out. They planted instead a trail of
                    tansy flowers for others to follow them.

                

                They set out on a heavy day.

 observed  you 
                    passing through the bay where they lived and chose to follow. They travelled along

                    cobblestone path until the stones ran out. They planted instead a trail of
                    tulip flowers for others to follow them.

                

                They set out on a foggy day.

 left their inlet and followed

                    flowers until the flowers ran thin. They planted instead a trail of
