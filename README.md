# Forks

A collaborative story told through automation.

Nov 17, 2022: This is a work in progress. Please feel free to fork the repository and explore it, though it is still a minimal exploration of the idea right now.

The conceit is that a journey of some kind is started by the user at the root of the repository tree, [lizadaly/forks](https://github.com/lizadaly/forks). Any immediate children of that repository have joined the journey early, and know who started it.

The story is automatically published on the Github Pages site for any repository, e.g. https://lizadaly.github.io/forks/ for the root story.

## Joining the story

All that is required is to fork this repository and you will be added to the story upstream.

You are encouraged to also generate a version of the story from your point of view. Doing so only requires
modifying some settings in your fork of this repository.

* Go to the Actions tab in your fork, and enable Workflows.
* Now go to Settings in your fork
* Select "Pages" from the left nav.
* Under "Build and deployment", select "Github Actions."

The story will automatically be built at `https://<your-username>.github.io/forks/`.

A fork can see limited activity "above it", and any activity "below it"â€”any forks of your fork.

Other people can join the journey "later", by forking forks rather than the original repository. **If a fork's code has deviated from the original repository, make sure you're comfortable with its changes.**
