# Forks

A collaborative story told through automation.

Nov 17, 2022: This is a work in progress. Please feel free to fork the repository and explore it, though it is still a minimal exploration of the idea right now.

The conceit is that a journey of some kind is started by the user at the root of the repository tree, [lizadaly/forks](https://github.com/lizadaly/forks). Any immediate children of that repository have joined the journey early, and know who started it.

The story is automatically published on the Github Pages site for any repository, e.g. https://lizadaly.github.io/forks/ for the root story.

## Joining the story

All that is required is to fork this repository and you will be added to the story upstream.

You can view the story from your POV by enabling Github Pages in your fork. A fork can see limited activity "above it", and any activity "below it"â€”any forks of your fork.

Other people can join the journey "later", by forking forks rather than the original repository. **If a fork's code has deviated from the original repository, make sure you're comfortable with its changes.**
